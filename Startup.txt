Startup

Step 1: Run the TicketAppWeb application to create the initial database (you may also need to run the Update-Database command in the package manager console) 
Step 2: Run the script 'seed data' on the local database created in step 1. The 'seed data' script is found in the code/scripts folder.

If those two steps worked you should be able to login to the application.
There should be a seeded admin user even if step 2 was not done.
